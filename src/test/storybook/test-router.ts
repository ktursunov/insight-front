/**
 * Standalone memory-history TanStack Router for stories — the SPA analogue
 * of the corporate fragment router (federation/packages/storybook-react/
 * src/preview/router.ts), minus the fragment binding.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT use the app's generated `routeTree.gen` here: a
 * story renders one component in isolation, so the router only needs to
 * provide a working `<Link>` / `useNavigate` / router context. The story
 * is mounted as the root route's `defaultNotFoundComponent` (set in
 * `with-providers.tsx`).
